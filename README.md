# SyncSms
Idea of this project is to sync messages that come on Android device and a notification is shown on bottom right of the computer so user must know that he has the message from someone without open the android device.

Why I am Making this ?

I was using push bullet to do this job but they have limit on sending 100 messages. So I created my own version which is free to all and everyone can receive and send unlimited no of messages.

Current Working scope.

1. Receiving Messages on computer 
2. Both Android device and Computer must be on same network because it is working with tcp client and server architecture.

Remaining Scope.

1. Sending msgs from computer 
2. Fix New bugs
